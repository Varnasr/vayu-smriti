# Vayu Smriti वायु स्मृति

**A Citizen-Led National Archive of India's Air Quality Crisis**

---

## About

Vayu Smriti (Air Memory) is a non-partisan, citizen-led initiative to build India's first comprehensive public archive documenting the air quality crisis — its data, its victims, its policies, and its public memory.

This is not a campaign. It is a record.

### What We Archive

- **Real-time AQI data** from 500+ monitoring stations (via OpenAQ/CPCB)
- **Health burden evidence** — mortality data, epidemiological studies
- **Policy and legal documents** — NCAP, GRAP, NGT/Supreme Court orders
- **Citizen testimonies** — firsthand accounts from affected communities
- **Journalism and investigations** — verified media coverage
- **Public sentiment** — satire, memes, cultural responses
- **Scientific research** — peer-reviewed papers, datasets

### Why This Exists

Every winter, India's air quality crisis dominates headlines. Every summer, it fades from public memory. Policy responses remain fragmented. Accountability is diffuse. Data is scattered across dozens of platforms.

Vayu Smriti creates a permanent, structured, publicly accessible record — so that evidence persists, patterns become visible, and accountability becomes possible.

## Delhi Climate Week 2026

Vayu Smriti launches at a national convening during **Delhi Climate Week (January/February 2026)** — bringing together journalists, researchers, civil society leaders, health professionals, and citizens to inaugurate the archive and establish its governance.

The archive will continue collecting and curating materials through **2027 and beyond**.

**This is a beginning, not an event.**
